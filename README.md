# glove_dryer
An Arduino-based boxing glove dryer.

This project uses an Arduino Uno to read relative humidity from two sensors; one inside one glove and another outside the glove. Based on the difference of the two values, it runs a number of PC fans to move wetter air out of the gloves and drier air into the gloves.
